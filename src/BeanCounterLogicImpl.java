 * 
 * <p>BeanCounterLogic: The bean counter, also known as a quincunx or the Galton
 * box, is a device for statistics experiments named after English scientist Sir
 * Francis Galton. It consists of an upright board with evenly spaced nails (or
 * pegs) in a triangular form. Each bean takes a random path and falls into a
 * slot.
 *
 * <p>Beans are dropped from the opening of the board. Every time a bean hits a
 * nail, it has a 50% chance of falling to the left or to the right. The piles
 * of beans are accumulated in the slots at the bottom of the board.
 * 
 * <p>This class implements the core logic of the machine. The MainPanel uses the
 * state inside BeanCounterLogic to display on the screen.
 * 
 * <p>Note that BeanCounterLogic uses a logical coordinate system to store the
 * positions of in-flight beans.For example, for a 4-slot machine:
 *                      (0, 0)
 *               (0, 1)        (1, 1)
 *        (0, 2)        (1, 2)        (2, 2)
 *  (0, 3)       (1, 3)        (2, 3)       (3, 3)
 * [Slot0]       [Slot1]       [Slot2]      [Slot3]
